I am a PhD student in [Linguistic Sciences](https://phd-sl.unibg.it/en/program) at **University of Bergamo** and **University of Pavia**. Before starting my PhD in 2021, I obtained a MA in [Theoretical and Applied Linguistics](https://studiumanistici.unipv.it/?pagina=p&titolo=CdLM-Linguistica-teorica) at University of Pavia with a thesis entitled *The influence of areal factors on word order: a statistical approach*.

My main interests, as suggested by the title of my MA thesis, are word order and language typology. My current project is focused on **semantic roles** from a **typological point of view**. I believe in **quantitave methods** applied to the analysis of languages.
